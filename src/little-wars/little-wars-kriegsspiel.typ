= APPENDIX: LITTLE WARS AND KRIEGSPIEL

THIS little book has, I hope, been perfectly frank about its
intentions. It is not a book upon Kriegspiel. It gives merely a game
that may be played by two or four or six amateurish persons in an
afternoon and evening with toy soldiers. But it has a very distinct
relation to Kriegspiel; and since the main portion of it was written
and published in a magazine, I have had quite a considerable
correspondence with military people who have been interested by it,
and who have shown a very friendly spirit towards it—in spite of the
pacific outbreak in its concluding section. They tell me—what I
already a little suspected—that Kriegspiel, as it is played by the
British Army, is a very dull and unsatisfactory exercise, lacking in
realism, in stir and the unexpected, obsessed by the umpire at every
turn, and of very doubtful value in waking up the imagination, which
should be its chief function. I am particularly indebted to Colonel
Mark Sykes for advice and information in this matter. He has pointed
out to me the possibility of developing Little Wars into a vivid and
inspiring Kriegspiel, in which the element of the umpire would be
reduced to a minimum; and it would be ungrateful to him, and a waste
of an interesting opportunity, if I did not add this Appendix,
pointing out how a Kriegspiel of real educational value for junior
officers may be developed out of the amusing methods of Little War. If
Great War is to be played at all, the better it is played the more
humanely it will be done. I see no inconsistency in deploring the
practice while perfecting the method. But I am a civilian, and
Kriegspiel is not my proper business. I am deeply preoccupied with a
novel I am writing, and so I think the best thing I can do is just to
set down here all the ideas that have cropped up in my mind, in the
footsteps, so to speak, of Colonel Sykes, and leave it to the military
expert, if he cares to take the matter up, to reduce my scattered
suggestions to a system.

Now, first, it is manifest that in Little Wars there is no equivalent
for rifle-fire, and that the effect of the gun-fire has no resemblance
to the effect of shell. That may be altered very simply. Let the rules
as to gun-fire be as they are now, but let a different projectile be
used—a projectile that will drop down and stay where it falls. I find
that one can buy in ironmongers' shops small brass screws of various
sizes and weights, but all capable of being put in the muzzle of the
4'7 guns without slipping down the barrel. If, with such a screw in
the muzzle, the gun is loaded and fired, the wooden bolt remains in
the gun and the screw flies and drops and stays near where it
falls—its range being determined by the size and weight of screw
selected by the gunner. Let us assume this is a shell, and it is quite
easy to make a rule that will give the effect of its explosion. Half,
or, in the case of an odd number, one more than half, of the men
within three inches of this shell are dead, and if there is a gun
completely within the circle of three inches radius from the shell, it
is destroyed. If it is not completely within the circle, it is
disabled for two moves. A supply waggon is completely destroyed if it
falls wholly or partially within the radius. But if there is a wall,
house, or entrenchment between any men and the shell, they are
uninjured—they do not count in the reckoning of the effect of the
shell.

I think one can get a practical imitation of the effect of rifle-fire
by deciding that for every five infantry-men who are roughly in a
line, and who do not move in any particular move, there may be one
(ordinary) shot taken with a 4'7 gun. It may be fired from any
convenient position behind the row of five men, so long as the shot
passes roughly over the head of the middle man of the five.

Of course, while in Little Wars there are only three or four players,
in any proper Kriegspiel the game will go on over a larger area—in a
drill-hall or some such place—and each arm and service will be
entrusted to a particular player. This permits all sorts of
complicated imitations of reality that are impossible to our parlour
and playroom Little Wars. We can consider transport, supply,
ammunition, and the moral effect of cavalry impact, and of uphill and
downhill movements. We can also bring in the spade and entrenchment,
and give scope to the Royal Engineers. But before I write anything of
Colonel Sykes' suggestions about these, let me say a word or two about
Kriegspiel "country."

The country for Kriegspiel should be made up, I think, of heavy blocks
or boxes of wood about 3 x 3 x 1/2 feet, and curved pieces (with a
rounded outline and a chord of three feet, or shaped like right-angled
triangles with an incurved hypotenuse and two straight sides of 3
feet) can easily be contrived to round off corners and salient
angles. These blocks can be bored to take trees, etc., exactly as the
boards in Little Wars are bored, and with them a very passable model
of any particular country can be built up from a contoured Ordnance
map. Houses may be made very cheaply by shaping a long piece of wood
into a house-like section and sawing it up. There will always be
someone who will touch up and paint and stick windows on to and
generally adorn and individualise such houses, which are, of course,
the stabler the heavier the wood used. The rest of the country as in
Little Wars.

Upon such a country a Kriegspiel could be played with rules upon the
lines of the following sketch rules, which are the result of a
discussion between Colonel Sykes and myself, and in which most of the
new ideas are to be ascribed to Colonel Sykes. We proffer them, not as
a finished set of rules, but as material for anyone who chooses to
work over them, in the elaboration of what we believe will be a far
more exciting and edifying Kriegspiel than any that exists at the
present time. The game may be played by any number of players,
according to the forces engaged and the size of the country
available. Each side will be under the supreme command of a General,
who will be represented by a cavalry soldier. The player who is
General must stand at or behind his representative image and within
six feet of it. His signalling will be supposed to be perfect, and he
will communicate with his subordinates by shout, whisper, or note, as
he thinks fit. I suggest he should be considered invulnerable, but
Colonel Sykes has proposed arrangements for his disablement. He would
have it that if the General falls within the zone of destruction of a
shell he must go out of the room for three moves (injured); and that
if he is hit by rifle-fire or captured he shall quit the game, and be
succeeded by his next subordinate.

Now as to the Moves.

It is suggested that:

- Infantry shall move one foot.
- Cavalry shall move three feet.
    - The above moves are increased by one half for troops in twos or
      fours on a road.
- Royal Engineers shall move two feet.
- Royal Artillery shall move two feet.
- Transport and Supply shall move one foot on roads, half foot across
  country.
- The General shall move six feet (per motor), three feet across
  country.
- Boats shall move one foot.
- In moving uphill, one contour counts as one foot; downhill, two
  contours count as one foot. Where there are four contours to one
  foot vertical the hill is impassable for wheels unless there is a road.

Infantry.

- To pass a fordable river = one move.
- To change from fours to two ranks = half a move.
- To change from two ranks to extension = half a move.
- To embark into boats = two moves for every twenty men embarked at
  any point.
- To disembark = one move for every twenty men.

Cavalry.

- To pass a fordable river = one move.
- To change formation = half a move.
- To mount = one move.
- To dismount = one move.

Artillery.

- To unlimber guns = half a move.
- To limber up guns = half a move.
- Rivers are impassable to guns.

NEITHER INFANTRY, CAVALRY, NOR ARTILLERY CAN FIRE AND MOVE IN ONE MOVE.

Royal Engineers.

- No repairs can be commenced, no destructions can be begun, during a
  move in which R.E. have changed position.
- Rivers impassable.

Transport and Supply.

- No supplies or stores can be delivered during a move if T. and S.
  have moved.
- Rivers impassable.

Next as to Supply in the Field:

All troops must be kept supplied with food, ammunition, and
forage. The players must give up, every six moves, one packet of food
per thirty men; one packet of forage per six horses; one packet of
ammunition per thirty infantry which fire for six consecutive moves.

These supplies, at the time when they are given up, must be within six
feet of the infantry they belong to and eighteen feet of the cavalry.

Isolated bodies of less than thirty infantry require no supplies—a
body is isolated if it is more than twelve feet off another body. In
calculating supplies for infantry the fractions either count as thirty
if fifteen or over, or as nothing if less than fifteen. Thus forty-six
infantry require two packets of food or ammunition; forty-four
infantry require one packet of food.

N.B.—Supplies are not effective if enemy is between supplies and
troops they belong to.

Men surrounded and besieged must be victualled at the following rate:—

One packet food for every thirty men for every six moves.

One packet forage every six horses for every six moves.

In the event of supplies failing, horses may take the place of food,
but not of course of forage; one horse to equal one packet.

In the event of supplies failing, the following consequences ensue:—

Infantry without ammunition cannot fire (guns are supposed to have
unlimited ammunition with them).

Infantry, cavalry, R.A., and R.E. cannot move without supply—if
supplies are not provided within six consecutive moves, they are out
of action.

A force surrounded must surrender four moves after eating its last
horse.

Now as to Destructions:

To destroy a railway bridge R.E. take two moves; to repair, R.E. take
ten moves.

To destroy a railway culvert R.E. take one move; to repair R.E. take
five moves. To destroy a river road bridge R.E. take one move; to
repair, R.E. take five moves.

A supply depot can be destroyed by one man in two moves, no matter how
large (by fire).

Four men can destroy the contents of six waggons in one move.

A contact mine can be placed on a road or in any place by two men in
six moves; it will be exploded by the first pieces passing over it,
and will destroy everything within six inches radius.#footnote[Notice
to be given to umpire of commencement of any work or the placing of a
mine. In event of no umpire being available, a folded note must be put
on the mantelpiece when entrenchment is commenced, and opponent asked
to open it when the trench is completed or the mine exploded.]<notice>

Next as to Constructions:

Entrenchments can be made by infantry in four moves.@notice They are to be
strips of wood two inches high tacked to the country, or wooden bricks
two inches high. Two men may make an inch of entrenchment.

Epaulements for guns may be constructed at the rate of six men to one
epaulement in four moves.@notice

Rules as to Cavalry Charging:

No body of less than eight cavalry may charge, and they must charge in
proper formation.

If cavalry charges infantry in extended order—

If the charge starts at a distance of more than two feet, the cavalry
loses one man for every five infantry-men charged, and the infantry
loses one man for each sabre charging.

At less than two feet and more than one foot, the cavalry loses one
man for every ten charged, and the infantry two men for each sabre
charging.

At less than one foot, the cavalry loses one man for every fifteen
charged, and the infantry three men for each sabre charging.

If cavalry charges infantry in close order, the result is reversed.

Thus at more than two feet one infantry-man kills three cavalry-men,
and fifteen cavalry-men one infantry-man.

At more than one foot one infantry-man kills two cavalry, and ten
cavalry one infantry.

At less than one foot one infantry-man kills one cavalry, and five
cavalry one infantry.

However, infantry that have been charged in close order are immobile
for the subsequent move.

Infantry charged in extended order must on the next move retire one
foot; they can be charged again.

If cavalry charges cavalry:—

If cavalry is within charging distance of the enemy's cavalry at the
end of the enemy's move, it must do one of three things—dismount,
charge, or retire. If it remains stationary and mounted and the enemy
charges, one charging sabre will kill five stationary sabres and put
fifteen others three feet to the rear.

Dismounted cavalry charged is equivalent to infantry in extended
order.

If cavalry charges cavalry and the numbers are equal and the ground
level, the result must be decided by the toss of a coin; the loser
losing three-quarters of his men and obliged to retire, the winner
losing one-quarter of his men.

If the numbers are unequal, the melee rules for Little Wars obtain if
the ground is level.

If the ground slopes, the cavalry charging downhill will be multiplied
according to the number of contours crossed. If it is one contour, it
must be multiplied by two; two contours, multiplied by three; three
contours, multiplied by four.

If cavalry retires before cavalry instead of accepting a charge, it
must continue to retire so long as it is pursued—the pursuers can only
be arrested by fresh cavalry or by infantry or artillery fire.

If driven off the field or into an unfordable river, the retreating
body is destroyed.

If infantry find hostile cavalry within charging distance at the end
of the enemy's move, and this infantry retires and yet is still within
charging distance, it will receive double losses if in extended order
if charged; and if in two ranks or in fours, will lose at three feet
two men for each charging sabre; at two feet, three men for each
charging sabre. The cavalry in these circumstances will lose
nothing. The infantry will have to continue to retire until their
tormentors have exterminated them or been driven off by someone else.

If cavalry charges artillery and is not dealt with by other forces,
one gun is captured with a loss to the cavalry of four men per gun for
a charge at three feet, three men at two feet, and one man at one
foot.

If artillery retires before cavalry when cavalry is within charging
distance, it must continue to retire so long as the cavalry pursues.

The introduction of toy railway trains, moving, let us say, eight feet
per move, upon toy rails, needs rules as to entraining and detraining
and so forth, that will be quite easily worked out upon the model of
boat embarkation here given. An engine or truck within the circle of
destruction of a shell will be of course destroyed.

The toy soldiers used in this Kriegspiel should not be the large
soldiers used in Little Wars. The British manufacturers who turn out
these also make a smaller, cheaper type of man—the infantry about an
inch high—which is better adapted to Kriegspiel purposes.

We hope, if these suggestions "catch on," to induce them to
manufacture a type of soldier more exactly suited to the needs of the
game, including tray carriers for troops in formation and (what is at
present not attainable) dismountable cavalry that will stand.

We place this rough sketch of a Kriegspiel entirely at the disposal of
any military men whose needs and opportunities enable them to work it
out and make it into an exacter and more realistic game. In doing so,
we think they will find it advisable to do their utmost to make the
game work itself, and to keep the need for umpire's decisions at a
minimum. Whenever possible, death should be by actual gun- and
rifle-fire and not by computation. Things should happen, and not be
decided. We would also like to insist upon the absolute need of an
official upon either side, simply to watch and measure the moves
taken, and to collect and check the amounts of supply and ammunition
given up. This is a game like real war, played against time, and
played under circumstances of considerable excitement, and it is
remarkable how elastic the measurements of quite honest and honourable
men can become.

We believe that the nearer that Kriegspiel approaches to an actual
small model of war, not only in its appearance but in its emotional
and intellectual tests, the better it will serve its purpose of trial
and education.
