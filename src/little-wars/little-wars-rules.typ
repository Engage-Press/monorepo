= THE RULES

HERE, then, are the rules of the perfect battle-game as we play it in an ordinary room.

== THE COUNTRY

#set enum(numbering: "(1)")

+ The Country must be arranged by one player, who, failing any other
  agreement, shall be selected by the toss of a coin.
+ The other player shall then choose which side of the field he will fight from.
+ The Country must be disturbed as little as possible in each
  move. Nothing in the Country shall be moved or set aside deliberately
  to facilitate the firing of guns. A player must not lie across the
  Country so as to crush or disturb the Country if his opponent
  objects. Whatever is moved by accident shall be replaced after the end
  of the move.

== THE MOVE

+ After the Country is made and the sides chosen, then (and not until
  then) the players shall toss for the first move.
+ If there is no curtain, the player winning the toss, hereafter
  called the First Player, shall next arrange his men along his back
  line, as he chooses. Any men he may place behind or in front of his
  back line shall count in the subsequent move as if they touched the
  back line at its nearest point. The Second Player shall then do the
  same. But if a curtain is available both first and second player may
  put down their men at the same time. Both players may take unlimited
  time for the putting down of their men; if there is a curtain it is
  drawn back when they are ready, and the game then begins.

3. The subsequent moves after the putting down are timed. The length
   of time given for each move is determined by the size of the forces
   engaged. About a minute should be allowed for moving 30 men and a
   minute for each gun. Thus for a force of 110 men and 3 guns, moved
   by one player, seven minutes is an ample allowance. As the battle
   progresses and the men are killed off, the allowance is reduced as
   the players may agree. The player about to move stands at attention
   a yard behind his back line until the timekeeper says "Go." He then
   proceeds to make his move until time is up. He must instantly stop
   at the cry of "Time." Warning should be given by the timekeeper two
   minutes, one minute, and thirty seconds before time is up. There
   will be an interval before the next move, during which any
   disturbance of the Country can be rearranged and men accidentally
   overturned replaced in a proper attitude. This interval must not
   exceed five or four minutes, as may be agreed upon.
+ Guns must not be fired before the second move of the first
  player—not counting the "putting down" as a move. Thus the first
  player puts down, then the second player, the first player moves, then
  the second player, and the two forces are then supposed to come into
  effective range of each other and the first player may open fire if he
  wishes to do so.
+ In making his move a player must move or fire his guns if he wants
  to do so, before moving his men. To this rule of "Guns First" there is
  to be no exception.
+ Every soldier may be moved and every gun moved or fired at each
  move, subject to the following rules:

=== MOBILITY OF THE VARIOUS ARMS

#set enum(numbering: "(I)")

(Each player must be provided with two pieces of string, one two feet
in length and the other six inches.)

+ An infantry-man may be moved a foot or any less distance at each move.
+ A cavalry-man may be moved two feet or any less distance at each move.
+ A gun is in action if there are at least four men of its own side
  within six inches of it. If there are not at least four men within
  that distance, it can neither be moved nor fired.
+ If a gun is in action it can either be moved or fired at each move,
  but not both. If it is fired, it may fire as many as four shots in
  each move. It may be swung round on its axis (the middle point of its
  wheel axle) to take aim, provided the Country about it permits; it may
  be elevated or depressed, and the soldiers about it may, at the
  discretion of the firer, be made to lie down in their places to
  facilitate its handling. Moreover, soldiers who have got in front of
  the fire of their own guns may lie down while the guns fire over
  them. At the end of the move the gun must be left without altering its
  elevation and pointing in the direction of the last shot. And after
  firing, two men must be placed exactly at the end of the trail of the
  gun, one on either side in a line directly behind the wheels. So much
  for firing. If the gun is moved and not fired, then at least four men
  who are with the gun must move up with it to its new position, and be
  placed within six inches of it in its new position. The gun itself
  must be placed trail forward and the muzzle pointing back in the
  direction from which it came, and so it must remain until it is swung
  round on its axis to fire. Obviously the distance which a gun can move
  will be determined by the men it is with; if there are at least four
  cavalry-men with it, they can take the gun two feet, but if there are
  fewer cavalry-men than four and the rest infantry, or no cavalry and
  all infantry, the gun will be movable only one foot.
+ Every man must be placed fairly clear of hills, buildings, trees,
  guns, etc. He must not be jammed into interstices, and either player
  may insist upon a clear distance between any man and any gun or other
  object of at least one-sixteenth of an inch. Nor must men be packed in
  contact with men. A space of one-sixteenth of an inch should be kept
  between them.
+ When men are knocked over by a shot they are dead, and as many men
  are dead as a shot knocks over or causes to fall or to lean so that
  they would fall if unsupported. But if a shot strikes a man but does
  not knock him over, he is dead, provided the shot has not already
  killed a man. But a shot cannot kill more than one man without
  knocking him over, and if it touches several without oversetting them,
  only the first touched is dead and the others are not incapacitated. A
  shot that rebounds from or glances off any object and touches a man,
  kills him; it kills him even if it simply rolls to his feet, subject
  to what has been said in the previous sentence.

#set enum(numbering: "(1)")

== HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING AND CAPTURING

+ A man or a body of men which has less than half its own number of
  men on its own side within a move of it, is said to be isolated. But
  if there is at least half its number of men of its own side within a
  move of it, it is not isolated; it is supported.
+ Men may be moved up into virtual contact (one-eighth of an inch or
  closer) with men of the opposite side. They must then be left until
  the end of the move.
+ At the end of the move, if there are men of the side that has just
  moved in contact with any men of the other side, they constitute a
  melee. All the men in contact, and any other men within six inches
  of the men in contact, measuring from any point of their persons,
  weapons, or horses, are supposed to take part in the melee. At the
  end of the move the two players examine the melee and dispose of the
  men concerned according to the following rules:—

#align(center, text(12pt)[
    Either the numbers taking part in the melee on each side are equal
    or unequal.
])

#set enum(numbering: "(a)")

+ If they are equal, all the men on both sides are killed.
+ If they are unequal, then the inferior force is either isolated or
  (measuring from the points of contact) not isolated.

#set enum(numbering: "(i)")

+ If it is isolated (see (1) above), then as many men become prisoners
  as the inferior force is less in numbers than the superior force, and
  the rest kill each a man and are killed. Thus nine against eleven have
  two taken prisoners, and each side seven men dead. Four of the eleven
  remain with two prisoners. One may put this in another way by saying
  that the two forces kill each other off, man for man, until one force
  is double the other, which is then taken prisoner. Seven men kill
  seven men, and then four are left with two.
+ But if the inferior force is not isolated (see (1) above), then each
  man of the inferior force kills a man of the superior force and is
  himself killed.

And the player who has just completed the move, the one who has
charged, decides, when there is any choice, which men in the melee,
both of his own and of his antagonist, shall die and which shall be
prisoners or captors.

All these arrangements are made after the move is over, in the
interval between the moves, and the time taken for the adjustment does
not count as part of the usual interval for consideration. It is extra
time.

The player next moving may, if he has taken prisoners, move these
prisoners. Prisoners may be sent under escort to the rear or wherever
the capturer directs, and one man within six inches of any number of
prisoners up to seven can escort these prisoners and go with
them. Prisoners are liberated by the death of any escort there may be
within six inches of them, but they may not be moved by the player of
their own side until the move following that in which the escort is
killed. Directly prisoners are taken they are supposed to be disarmed,
and if they are liberated they cannot fight until they are rearmed. In
order to be rearmed they must return to the back line of their own
side. An escort having conducted prisoners to the back line, and so
beyond the reach of liberation, may then return into the fighting
line.

Prisoners once made cannot fight until they have returned to their
back line. It follows, therefore, that if after the adjudication of a
melee a player moves up more men into touch with the survivors of this
first melee, and so constitutes a second melee, any prisoners made in
the first melee will not count as combatants in the second melee. Thus
if A moves up nineteen men into a melee with thirteen of B's—B having
only five in support—A makes six prisoners, kills seven men, and has
seven of his own killed. If, now, B can move up fourteen men into
melee with A's victorious survivors, which he may be able to do by
bringing the five into contact, and getting nine others within six
inches of them, no count is made of the six of B's men who are
prisoners in the hands of A. They are disarmed. B, therefore, has
fourteen men in the second melee and A twelve, B makes two prisoners,
kills ten of A's men, and has ten of his own killed. But now the six
prisoners originally made by A are left without an escort, and are
therefore recaptured by B. But they must go to B's back line and
return before they can fight again. So, as the outcome of these two
melees, there are six of B's men going as released prisoners to his
back line whence they may return into the battle, two of A's men
prisoners in the hands of B, one of B's staying with them as escort,
and three of B's men still actively free for action. A, at a cost of
nineteen men, has disposed of seventeen of B's men for good, and of
six or seven, according to whether B keeps his prisoners in his
fighting line or not, temporarily.

#set enum(numbering: "(1)")

4. Any isolated body may hoist the white flag and surrender at any
   time.
+ A gun is captured when there is no man whatever of its original side
  within six inches of it, and when at least four men of the
  antagonist side have moved up to it and have passed its wheel axis
  going in the direction of their attack. This latter point is
  important. An antagonist's gun may be out of action, and you may
  have a score of men coming up to it and within six inches of it, but
  it is not yet captured; and you may have brought up a dozen men all
  round the hostile gun, but if there is still one enemy just out of
  their reach and within six inches of the end of the trail of the
  gun, that gun is not captured: it is still in dispute and out of
  action, and you may not fire it or move it at the next move. But
  once a gun is fully captured, it follows all the rules of your own
  guns.

= VARIETIES OF THE BATTLE-GAME

You may play various types of game.

1. One is the Fight to the Finish. You move in from any points you
   like on the back line and try to kill, capture, or drive over his
   back line the whole of the enemy's force. You play the game for
   points; you score 100 for the victory, and 10 for every gun you
   hold or are in a position to take, 1-1/2 for every cavalry-man, 1
   for every infantry-man still alive and uncaptured, 1/2 for every
   man of yours prisoner in the hands of the enemy, and 1/2 for every
   prisoner you have taken. If the battle is still undecided when both
   forces are reduced below fifteen men, the battle is drawn and the
   100 points for victory are divided.

Note—This game can be fought with any sized force, but if it is fought
with less than 50 a side, the minimum must be 10 a side.

2. The Blow at the Rear game is decided when at least three men of one
   force reach any point in the back line of their antagonist. He is then
   supposed to have suffered a strategic defeat, and he must retreat his
   entire force over the back line in six moves, i.e. six of his
   moves. Anything left on the field after six moves capitulates to the
   victor. Points count as in the preceding game, but this lasts a
   shorter time and is better adapted to a cramped country with a short
   back line. With a long rear line the game is simply a rush at some
   weak point in the first player's line by the entire cavalry brigade of
   the second player. Instead of making the whole back line available for
   the Blow at the Rear, the middle or either half may be taken.
+ In the Defensive Game, a force, the defenders, two-thirds as strong
  as its antagonist, tries to prevent the latter arriving, while still a
  quarter of its original strength, upon the defender's back line. The
  Country must be made by one or both of the players before it is
  determined which shall be defender. The players then toss for choice
  of sides, and the winner of the toss becomes the defender. He puts out
  his force over the field on his own side, anywhere up to the distance
  of one move off the middle line—that is to say, he must not put any
  man within one move of the middle line, but he may do so anywhere on
  his own side of that limit—and then the loser of the toss becomes
  first player, and sets out his men a move from his back line. The
  defender may open fire forthwith; he need not wait until after the
  second move of the first player, as the second player has to do.

= COMPOSITION OF FORCES

Except in the above cases, or when otherwise agreed upon, the forces
engaged shall be equal in number and similar in composition. The
methods of handicapping are obvious. A slight inequality (chances of
war) may be arranged between equal players by leaving out 12 men on
each side and tossing with a pair of dice to see how many each player
shall take of these. The best arrangement and proportion of the forces
is in small bodies of about 20 to 25 infantry-men and 12 to 15 cavalry
to a gun. Such a force can maneuver comfortably on a front of 4 or 5
feet. Most of our games have been played with about 80 infantry, 50
cavalry, 3 or 4 naval guns, and a field gun on either side, or with
smaller proportional forces. We have played excellent games on an
eighteen-foot battlefield with over two hundred men and six guns a
side. A player may, of course, rearrange his forces to suit his own
convenience; brigade all or most of his cavalry into a powerful
striking force, or what not. But more guns proportionally lead to
their being put out of action too early for want of men; a larger
proportion of infantry makes the game sluggish, and more
cavalry—because of the difficulty of keeping large bodies of this
force under cover—leads simply to early heavy losses by gunfire and
violent and disastrous charging. The composition of a force may, of
course, be varied considerably. One good Fight to a Finish game we
tried as follows: We made the Country, tossed for choice, and then
drew curtains across the middle of the field. Each player then
selected his force from the available soldiers in this way: he counted
infantry as 1 each, cavalry as 1-1/2, and a gun as 10, and, taking
whatever he liked in whatever position he liked, he made up a total of
150\. He could, for instance, choose 100 infantry and 5 guns, or 100
cavalry and no guns, or 60 infantry, 40 cavalry, and 3 guns. In the
result, a Boer-like cavalry force of 80 with 3 guns suffered defeat at
the hands of 110 infantry with 4.

= SIZE OF THE SOLDIERS

The soldiers used should be all of one size. The best British makers
have standardised sizes, and sell infantry and cavalry in exactly
proportioned dimensions; the infantry being nearly two inches
tall. There is a lighter, cheaper make of perhaps an inch and a half
high that is also available. Foreign-made soldiers are of variable
sizes.
